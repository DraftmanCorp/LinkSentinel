# LinkSentinel Pro.
**A lightweight yet powerful tool to long-term monitor internet connectivity on Windows 7/8/10/11 PC ‚Äî 24/7 logging, visible or hidden.**

### üß† What is LinkSentinel?
**LinkSentinel** is a simple but powerful PowerShell script that allows any Windows 10 or 11 machine to monitor its internet connection status continuously, either **visibly** (with console output) or **silently** (in background).
It immediately creates a log file that tracks connection status every few seconds (customizable by the user), and logs are readable and openable at any time ‚Äî even while the script is running.
To avoid huge log files, a new log file is automatically started every 24 hours, named like: "Log_monitor_YYYY-MM-DD.txt"

### üöÄ How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Launch the `Start_hidden.bat` file to run in background, or run `Start_console.bat` to run in visible console mode
3. By default, the check and log interval is set to 10 seconds - you can edit this interval editing the Script.ps1 file, to the last line "Start-Sleep -Seconds 10"
4. By default, LinkSentinel checks connectivity to Google, Microsoft, and Cloudflare servers. If you want to modify these targets, edit the script.ps1 file to the section: "$targets = @("
